# Myths-Connect
An immersive archive made for DIGHUM160A. A Unity game similar to Pokemon Go/Animal Crossing but with myths indigenous to the region. I ended up dropping this and switching to another project because it was difficult working out the map issues with the fast-approaching deadline, but I learned a lot.

I know very little about Unity or virtual game creation so not much has been implemented yet!

so I relied a lot on many tutorials and references online.
Here's a list!
